# Face-Mask-Detection-using-CNN
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect whether individuals in images are wearing face masks or not. The model is trained on labeled face images and can classify them into "Mask" and "No Mask" categories with high accuracy, supporting real-time monitoring and safety enforcement.
